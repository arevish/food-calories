# Food Calorie          ![forthebadge](https://forthebadge.com/images/badges/made-with-python.svg)
## Scenario:-
You visited a restaurant and the food items in that restaurant are sorted, based on their amount of calories. You have to reserve this list of food items containing calories.

## Instructions to follow
You have to use the following three methods to reserve a list:

* Inbuild method of python
* List name [::-1] slicing trick
* Swap the first element with the last one and second element with second last one and so on like,
`[6 7 8 34 5] -> [5 34 8 7 6]`

**Input:**

Take a list as an input from the user

`[5, 4, 1]`

**Output:**
```
[1, 4, 5]

[1, 4, 5]

[1, 4, 5]
```
All three methods give the same results!
